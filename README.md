Here are two applications

- `kohomology-cli`: Run the application in the command line. (recommended)
- `kohomology-browser`: Run the application in the browser.

## Usage
You can run each application by the following way:

- Windows: Click `runner.bat` from Explorer
- Mac, Linux: Run `runner.sh` from terminal (or possibly click it?)

You can define your own chain complex and compute its cohomology by editing the script `src/main/kotlin/main.kt`.
